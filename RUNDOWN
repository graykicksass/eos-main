Eternity Core
===================

Alright, a simple breakdown of how this system will work:

	- Frontend will be rendered in XHTML and provide the display for the screen.
	- Frontend_Client will define the majority of the look and feel across the OS.
	- Frontend_Client will connect to the framework server to get objects on screen, objects can be updated by the framework server.
	- The framework server hosts APIs provided to Eternity applications and provides the bridge between an app and the desktop client.
	- Applications will connect to the framework server via tcp or named pipe.
