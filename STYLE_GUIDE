Eternity Coding Style Guide:
============================
Last Modified: 4/4/2010 - Gray

Since Eternity's goal in part reaches for consistent coding style, code should conform to certain style guides.

For the most part, it should conform to the webkit style guide here: http://webkit.org/coding/coding-style.html. EXCEPT for python which will use a tab indent instead of 4 spaces.
